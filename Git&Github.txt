Git

Git is an Source code management

Workflow

*** Local file (git add) --> Staging Area (git commit)--> Commit the file (git push)--> Remote repository ***



1.git init(Initailize a git in local directory)

2.git add -A (Add the files)

3.git commit (Moving the files to staging area)

4.git push (Pushing to remote) If 1st time git remote add {Repo link}

5.origin --Why?

Internally, "origin" is set as the remote repository link when you clone a Git repository. (git remote -v)

6.git log (Checking logs of previous commits) --oneline --author --since --until

*****Git branches******

1.git branch {branch_name} (Create a branch)
2.git checkout {branch name}(Pointing head to that new branch)
3.git checkout -b {branch name}(Create and point)[preffered]
4.git branch -d {branch name}(delete in local)
5.git push origin {branch name} --delete(Delete in remote)

These checkout makes a exact copy from base branch where you checked out

When you use this feature branches
==>When new need to added ,modified or deleted
==>checkout a new feature branch 
==>made the changes and merge to base branch


Merging the branches

==> Commit the changes in feature branch and checkout to base branch and git merge feature.It merge the things ,Then push to remote
==> Commit the changes in feature branch and push the feature branch to remote raise PR and merge to Base branch(Preffered)

Merging conflicts

1.A and B pulls the remote changes parellelly
2.A commit the changes in file1.txt and merge the changes
3.B commit the his changes in file1.txt and try to merge with base branch
4.There occurs a merge conflicts
5.Need to fix the conflict ,commit and merge

Out-of-Sync

Same scenario here also but with other files so it won't conflict
1.git checkout base branch
2.git pull origin base
3.git checkout feature
4.git merge base

In the above we are pulling the latest base branch and merge out to feature so it will fast forward

Fetch vs pull

1.git fetch origin branch_name
this will fetch the remote branch but not merge to our local

2.git pull origin branch_name (Fetch and merge)
this will fetch the remote branch and merge to local
