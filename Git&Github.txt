Git

Git is an Source code management

Workflow

*** Local file (git add) --> Staging Area (git commit)--> Commit the file (git push)--> Remote repository ***



1.git init(Initailize a git in local directory)

2.git add -A (Add the files)

3.git commit (Moving the files to staging area)

4.git push (Pushing to remote) If 1st time git remote add {Repo link}

5.origin --Why?

Internally, "origin" is set as the remote repository link when you clone a Git repository. (git remote -v)

6.git log (Checking logs of previous commits) --oneline --author --since --until

*****Git branches******

1.git branch {branch_name} (Create a branch)
2.git checkout {branch name}(Pointing head to that new branch)
3.git checkout -b {branch name}(Create and point)[preffered]

These checkout makes a exact copy from base branch where you checked out

When you use this feature branches
==>When new need to added ,modified or deleted
==>checkout a new feature branch 
==>made the changes and merge to base branch


**Need to check scenarios (git reset,rebase,revert and cherrypick these things)
